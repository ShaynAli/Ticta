Game
-Game needs a way to receive player moves from the server, added interface class to connect the server and the game class,
this will the move from the server and the player whos turn it is and compute the logic, basically a wrapper for the game.
The game will need to be reworked in a way so that the interface can send the turns to it without the need to input from the
console. The messages will be passed from the interface to the server in the following way:

Interface to Server - String:
    1 for success, 0 for failure, 2 for game end, 3 for anything else think error followed by a space,
    if the game has ended the next word will be win or draw followed by a space then if win,
     the number of the player who won (if a then 0, b = 1, Z = 51) lastly,
     column, row or diagonal and the number of the column or row or 0 for \ and 1 for / or simply timeout if player ran out of time
